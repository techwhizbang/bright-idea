## Summary ##

All too often the subtleties between integration and functional testing
are blurred.

"Bright Idea" is a coding kata focused on teaching developers
the differences between unit, integration, and functional testing.

## Description ##

You've bought an old house that needs lots of restoration. One of the many
projects to tackle in the house is to update the tacky and mostly inoperable
lighting systems that date back to the 1960's.

Among the many decisions to make, you've decided to upgrade one room at a time, starting with
the guest room.

In order to make the guest room warm and inviting you've chosen a sleek set of
sconces. Beside the sconces you want to install a dimmer switch with a timer on it.

In any lighting system there are many individual components that make a fully "functional" solution.
As you think about the list of lighting components and how they "integrate", you should
start to draw the parallels in the software you code and test everyday.

Here is the list of lighting componentry:

* A pair of bedroom sconces
* Dimmable CFL bulbs (eco-friendly and energy efficient)
* Bedroom wiring
